# QR Code Maker
The project is simple. Make QR codes less annoying to use (using QR codes and Python)

**About the QR Code maker**

The program will create an optimal QR code depending on the data you wish to store.

**Usage**

1. Run the program.

2. Input the desired file name. Inclue .png or .jpeg depending on what file you want to make.

3. Then input the data you want to store. links work especially well, with simple sentences (according to my testing) only working on android - but that just me.

heads up the QR codes will be stored in the direcotry where the program file resides.

**Things to Note**

I will be working on storing images in QR codes and saving the files in custom location in later releases.
