# QR Travel
The project is simple. Make travelling on public transport less annoying (using QR codes and Python)

**About QR Busing**

QR Travel makes it easy to find out when your means of transport will arrive. It allows you to check the bus schedule by simply scanning a QR code.

**Usage**

1. Scan our QR code which are located on bus stop signs via your phones camera.      This will redirect you to google maps.

2. When you are on the bus stop's page click the under the subheading buses. This    will take you to the bus stops schedule.

**Things to Note**

If there is a bus stop you frequently use that does not have one of our QR codes. Please contact our staff @EME-YE.
